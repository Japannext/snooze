Overview
========

Located on the **utils** page of the Web UI, **Key-values** offers a fast and efficient way to store dictionnaries that can be used for mapping alert's specific fields.

Being used as a **Modification** in :ref:`Rules <kv_mapping>`, **Key-values** are usually used for replacing multiple *condition/set modification* pairs, which not only favors readability but also greatly reduces processing time.

Web interface

Time Constraints

Overview
========

**Time Constraints** are an additional type of control used to determine whether an alert should be processed by the corresponding plugin or not.

List of time constraints:

* DateTime_
* Time_
* Weekdays_

When using multiple time constraints of the **same** type, **only one** needs to match for the time constraint to be matching.

When using multiple time constraints of **different** types, **all** of them need to match for the time constraint to be matching.

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Summary

    Time Constraint = (DateTime A OR DateTime B)
                        AND (Time A OR Time B) AND (Weekday A OR Weekday B)

.. caution::

    Starting time begins at 0 second. Ending time finishes at 59 seconds.
    For example, ``04:30 - 07:29`` representation starts at ``04:30:00`` and ends at ``07:29:59``

DateTime
--------

In ``Year-Month-Day Hour(24):Minute`` format, **DateTime** is the only time representation that actually expires.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Example

    datetime:
      - from: 2022-01-01 00:00
        until: 2022-01-31 23:59
      - from: 2022-05-01 00:00
        until: 2022-05-31 23:59

Alerts matching this time constraint need to have their timestamp in January 2022 or in May 2022.

Web interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To select a range, click on the starting date then on ending date on the calendar. Time can be set by clicking on the clock icon. To select a 1 day range, click on a date twice (the selected area should become a square)

.. hint::

    DateTime and Time can be copy pasted or manually inputted using the keyboard.

Time
----

In ``Hour(24):Minute``, **Time** by itself represents a daily interval.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Example

    time:
      - from: 04:00
        until: 07:59
      - from: 16:00
        until: 19:59

Alerts matching this time constraint need to have their timestamp between 04:00:00 and 07:59:59 or between 16:00:00 and 19:59:59

Web interface

Weekdays
--------

Accepts a list of numbers matching their corresponding weekday. Weeks start on Sunday (0)

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Example

    weekdays:
      - weekdays: [0, 1]

Alerts matching this time constraint need to have their timestamp in Sunday or Monday

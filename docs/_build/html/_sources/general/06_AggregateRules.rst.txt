    Architecture - Aggregate Rules plugin

Overview
========

Group Alerts based on matching fields and a throttle period.

Alerts have to match the Aggregate's condition in order to being processed.

Aggregate rules are mainly designed to prevent similar Alerts from being notified especially if they were sent in burst or the process generating them was flapping.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Example

    # Alert A
    host: prod-syslog01.example.com
    process: sssd[2564]
    message: Preauthentication failed
    timestamp: 2021-01-01 10:00:00

    # Alert B
    host: prod-syslog01.example.com
    process: sssd[2566]
    message: Preauthentication failed
    timestamp: 2021-01-01 10:10:00

    # Alert C
    host: prod-syslog01.example.com
    process: sssd[2569]
    message: Preauthentication failed
    timestamp: 2021-01-01 10:20:00

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Aggregate rule
    fields:
        - host
        - message
    throttle: 900 # 15 mins

All three alerts have the same fields ``host`` and ``message``.

Alert A being the first one processed, it was correctly passed to the next Process plugin. The throttle period started from Alert A timestamp.

Alert B was processed 10 minutes after Alert A which was lower than the throttle period (15 mins), therefore Alert B was not passed to the next Process plugin.

Alert C was processed 20 minutes after Alert A which was greater than the throttle period, therefore Alert C was correctly passed to the next Process plugin. The throttle period restarted from Alert C timestamp.

**Note**: On the web interface, it is possible to see how many times an alert was aggregated by checking the number on the very right on **Alerts** page:

Web interface
=============

    :align: center

:Name*: Name of the aggregate rule.
:|condition|: This aggregate rule will be triggered only if this condition is matched. Leave it blank to always match.
:Fields: Space separated fields used to group incoming alerts.
:Watch: Space separated fields used to bypass the throttle period if they get updated.
:Throttle: Number of seconds to wait before escalating the next alert matching this aggregate rule (-1 for infinite).
:Flapping: Maximum number of times to be alerted during the throttle period.
:Comment: Description.

.. |condition| replace:: :ref:`Condition <conditions>`
